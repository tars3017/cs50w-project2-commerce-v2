# cs50w-project2-commerce-v2
---
It was a assignment from "CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". I have spent too much time on this project so I decided
most parts of the functionalities and then leave it behind and start the new chapter. Thus, there may be bunches of bugs, lots of English 
vocabulary misuse and without any decoration. Nevertheless, I would be happy if someone want to try out my work. To do so, just clone the repository,
go into the directory, run ```python3 manage.py runserver```, click on the localhost link, and you can interact with the website.

## Simply Introduce the Function
---
It is a "e-Bay" like commerce website, you can add a item, bid on items, close the bid, add an items to watch list...and so on.

## Some Notes
---
The icons in the website are from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)
